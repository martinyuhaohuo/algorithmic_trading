    "    - algorithmic trading is adopted to explot the arbitrage opportunities across markets (e.g. between private and public market of same asset) \n",
    "    - as arbitrage opportunities are temporal (from milliscond to minute), the speed of algorithmic trading robots matter\n",
    "    - there was an arms race for speed between algorithmic trading firms\n",
    "- Execution algorithms:\n",
    "    - Then algroithmic trading is used to minimize the price impact of selling / buying assets\n",
    "    - Determines when, how many units, and at what price the order should be placed to achieve a decision of buying/selling x units\n",
    "    - This brings benefits on:\n",
    "        - Prevent information leakage of selling large amount of security\n",
    "        - Reduce execution cost of portfolio rebalancing (for ETF, need to rebalance portfolio everyday)\n",
    "        - ETF: a firm that buy securities and commit to track a market index, so when share price changes, need to rebalance portfolio\n",
    "- Situational algorithm:\n",
    "    - Finally, algorithm is used to implement a particular tactical investment strategies\n",
    "    - Basically rely on prediction for future price changes"
