    "- **English Auction: Open Ascending Price**\n",
    "    - Price rises continuously\n",
    "    - Bidders need to indicate their interest to buy at current price (e.g. raising hands)\n",
    "    - Or drop out when the prices rises above their value (e.g. lowering their hands)\n",
    "        - Auction ends when only one bidder remains in bidding\n",
    "    - Can be extended to multiple objects:\n",
    "        - If traded objects are complementarities (higher value if purchased together), can use combinatorial auction\n",
    "        - Such auction allow participants to bid for a combination (bundle) of objects\n",
    "        - Different participants can bid for different combination / or individual objects\n",
    "- **Dutch Auction: Open Descending Price**\n",
    "    - Usually faster than English Auction\n",
    "    - Price falls continuously\n",
    "    - The first bidder to indicate interest wins the auction\n",

    "    - In FP or Dutch auction, however, risk adverse bidder will bid higher (reduce risk by trading lower payoff from winning for higher chance of winning)"

    "- **Description:**\n",
    "    - Only certain players have the right to post bid and ask quotes and thus supply liquidity (providing immediatecy to traders)\n",
    "    - These players are called market makers or dealers\n",
    "    - Example include: Forex market, OTC, US futures markets\n",
    "- **Obligations:** \n",
    "    - Post quotes, limit on spread between bid and ask price, face minimum on quantity of trade, reporting requirements\n",
    "- **Privileges:** \n",
    "    - Right to post quotes, information about order flow and book, lower or no fees paid to the exchange\n",
    "- **Revenues:**\n",
    "    - Dealers try to buy at low price (bid price they set) & sell at high price (ask price they set)\n",
    "    - Earn bid-ask spread\n",
    "- **Cost:**\n",
    "    - There is a time between purchase & sale of the asset\n",
    "    - During this period, dealer need to hold security in inventory\n",
    "    - This lead to risk bearing cost/inventory cost\n",
    "    - For example, if market buy (investor buys security from the dealer) is followed by permanent price increase of the security, dealers bear a loss\n",
    "    - Especially common if market orders placed by informed agents\n",
    "- **Competition between Dealers:**\n",
    "    - Under perfect competition, bid-ask spread should soley reflect compensation for inventory costs & adverse selection costs \n",
    "    - e.g. if traders have more information than dealer, market buy happen only if followed by permanent price increase, market sell happen only if followed by price decrease\n",
    "    - If dealers ahve market power, spreads will reflect rents\n",
    "- **Benefit of Dealer Market:**\n",
    "    - There is a fixed cost to provide liquidity: \n",
    "        - Ensure connection with electronic system throughout the session (taking liquidity through market order, on the other hand, only require connection at time placing order)\n",
    "        - Monitor order flow continuously to update quotes, otherwise incur loss (stay on the floor historically)\n",
    "        - Invest in information acquisition (order flow, news)\n",
    "        - These cost exist regardless to the trade volume\n",
    "    - Market marker trade frequently with many investors, thus can efficiently spread this cost over many trades\n",
    "        - On the other hand, if the market is order driven, investors placing limit order need to incur the fixed cost\n",
    "        - It is hard to spread the cost, as they do not trade frequently as market maker\n",
    "    - Finally, it takes initial liquidity to attract orders\n",
    "        - Market makers post quotes even when order flow is low, this guarantees liquidity at day one of the market (priming the pump)\n",
    "        - With out market makers, for a new market, there is intially no order, thus attracting no trader, reinforcing the no-order dilemma\n",
    "- **Drawback of Dealer Market:**\n",
    "    - There is a risk that dealers collude (increase bid-ask spread)\n",
    "    - Evidence: \n",
    "        - Before 1997, Nasdaq dealers traded only even eighths\n",
    "        - After a revelaing article, suddenly use odd eighths\n",
    "    - SEC Order Handling rule (1997) required that limit orders must be displayed\n",
    "    - Now investors compete more to supply liquidity (spreads decreased)\n"
