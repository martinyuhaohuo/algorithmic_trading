    "- An algorithm is a set of instructions that implements a strategy\n",
    "- A stratgey is a plan of action (pure / or mixed) for each contingency (situation) one agent may encounter\n",
    "    - Even for contingencies that one do not think will ever happen (those off the equilibrium path)\n",
    "- Game theory is a subject that investigates games and equilibrium stratgies in these games"

    "- **Strategy:** a decision rule that describes the actions a player will take at each decision point (contingencies)\n",

    "- It is wrong to believe that mixed stratgey is for hiding intention of the player (which would imply 50-50 mixing)\n",
    "- Instead, mixed stratgey (randomizing with a specific p) is to ensuring that opponent will be indifferent between actions and thus also randomizing\n",

    "- Suppose the costs of Monitoring decreases and changes the payoffs for Manager\n",

    "- However, now the Worker need to change the mixed stratgey to make the manager still indifferent between Monitor and Not Monitor\n",
    "    - If do not change stratgey, the manager now has more incentive for monitoring due to lower monitor cost\n",
    "    - Hence, Worker will mix with $P_W = 0.625$ \n",
    "- It is quite counter-intuitive that decrease in monitoring costs does not change the probability that the manager monitors, but increases the probability that the worker works\n",
    "- The game theory predicts that the mixed strategy adopted at NE only depends on the payoff of other player\n",
    "    - The goal of randomizing is enforcing that the opponent is indifferent between actions (and thus also mixing) and thus also randomizing\n",
    "    - Hence, the mixed stratgey at NE does not depend on player's own payoff\n",
