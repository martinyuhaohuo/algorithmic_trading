    "    - There are also 15 sellers facing charges (marginal cost) equal to 2, 5, 8, 10 and 12 dollar\n",
    "    - Each buyer and seller has only one unit of the item\n",
    "    - Question: \n",
    "        - What prices do we expect to see when trade happens\n",
    "        - What is the quantity of trade in total\n",
    "- Prediction by Walrasian Equilirium:\n",
    "    - We can construct discrete demand and supply curve based on marginal utility / cost\n",
    "    - The equilibrium appears at the point where two curves intersect\n",
    "    - That is, 18-20 units would be traded at a uniform price between $8 and $9\n",
    "    - The allocation is Pareto optimal\n",
    "- Feynman’s Critique:\n",
    "    - The economists are only right on average\n",
    "    - Trade can occur with heterergenous prices fluctuating between 2 and 15\n",
    "    - Trade volume would be at least 20\n",
    "    - The allocation can be not Pareto optimal (Pareto inferior): \n",
    "        - e.g. outcome 1: match seller buyer as below: 15-12, 12-10, 9-8, 7-5, 5-2, total welfare 11\n",
    "        - this is not pareto optimal, as we can re-match: 15-2, 12-5, 9-8, trading at uniform price = 8, welfare = 21\n",
    "        - we can redistribute the welfare to compensate the untraded seller/buyer \n",
    "        - e.g. although seller with MC=12 do not trade, give him/her 3 units, so payoff the same as in first outcome\n",
